#### Technologies

- React
- JSX

## Using the App

There are multiple pages, of which are all of them standard to see in this type of application.

Note that you will be prompted to log in on first load, of which the session will be kept in storage for future use. All pages are navigable using the UI, but you may navigate in the url if you wish. For mobile devices use the drop down locatable in the top right of the app.

#### Pages

- Login /login
- Home /home
- Topics /topics
- Topic /topics/:topic
